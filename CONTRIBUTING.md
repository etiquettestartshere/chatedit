### Make an Issue
Unless your PR is very simple, please make an accompanying issue.

### v11 and v12 Dual Support
Because this module is currently supporting both version 11 and version 12 of foundry, please make sure any pull requests you submit have been tested on both versions (or you are very, very sure that it dos not rely on something exclusive to v12). I do not want to do that testing myself for code I didn't write.

### Target Milestone or Latest Branch
Any PRs should be sent to the latest branch, or, if applicable, a milestone branch.

### Scope
This module is designed with an intentionally limited scope. It is not a 'chat enhancement' module. It provides editing and markdown capabilities. The only other features I would strongly consider adding are features that directly allow manipulation of the chat experience, such as resizing or tabbing. Any features designed solely around chat identity or style belong in another module, as do any features not directly related to the chat. It is extremely unlikely I will add any features related to chat archival, as I simply use foundry's .txt export and have no desire to maintain features I won't use.

### Notes
This module is opinionated, as it was developed for my own game, and it will continued to be used there. It is primarily for text roleplayers, and any development direction (at least of this fork) will be in that vein.

I have commented the module very extensively, in the hopes that if someone does decide to carry it forward to v13 if I do not (and they have no knowledge about JS, as I did when I started messing with Foundry), that this will make it easier for them.
